-reviewed the worksheet, can play with the numbers and see how it changes parameters
-I prefer the public/cloudera one for Yarn as there is more detail, more checks, use to it I guess, etc
-Workload factor is a indicator of load, could also consider as more io intensive vs cpu intensive
-Increase memory.map, made memory.reduce double of map, changed related settings
-this is very theoretical, thumb suck. But in reality would try to get a feel of type of workload and ajust accordingly, monitor solution and adjusted as needed
